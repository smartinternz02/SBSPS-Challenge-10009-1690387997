Plug &amp; Power: Revolutionizing the Road - A complete guide to Electric Vehicle Charging Station

Overview:
Electric vehicle charging stations are dedicated infrastructure facilities that provide electric vehicles with the ability to recharge their batteries. These stations supply electric power
to the vehicle's battery, allowing EV owners to extend their driving range and reduce reliance on traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. As the popularity of electric vehicles continues to grow, 
the availability and accessibility of charging stations are crucial for EV adoption. Governments, businesses, and organizations are investing in expanding charging infrastructure to support the increasing
number of electric vehicles on the road and promote sustainable transportation. The Plug & Power project aims to empower electric vehicle owners by providing them with accurate, real-time information about 
charging stations, making the transition to electric mobility smoother and more convenient. By encouraging the use of electric vehicles and facilitating access to charging infrastructure, we strive to
contribute to a greener and more sustainable future on the roads. We can store the particular user data for the charge like the charging station name, billing, charging type, how much time it too to charge.
We can also provide user with the inforrmation that if user want to reach to a particular charging station will the current battery be enough to take the user on that location.
